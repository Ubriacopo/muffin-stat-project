\section{Introduction}
The task to fulfill in this report was the classification of Muffins and Chihuahuas
by designing various possible Neural Networks that solve the task. Being this a classification
problem, where each object has a specific label, and there being only two classes this
falls under the class of \textbf{Binary Classification Problems}.

The results that I am going to discuss are based on best practices and empirical
evidence gathered from the scientific community for various years.


\section{Machine and environment information}
In order to replicate at best the results obtained by my search.

\subsection{Machine Information}
I have done all computations on my own machine as I have a
GPU to take advantage of. The system on which I performed
the tasks mounts Ubuntu 22.04 and is defined by the HW:
Machine :
\begin{itemize}
    \item GPU: NVIDIA RTX4070Ti (6GB VRAM)
    \item CPU: AMD Ryzen ... (32 GB RAM)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development Environment}
Libraries (just list them)

Very brief explanation what keras is

Why Torch  (Keras 3.0)
