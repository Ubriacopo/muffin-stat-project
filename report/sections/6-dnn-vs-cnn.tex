\section{Comparison of DNN and CNN}

as already explained before the results on the DNN were convincing but
CNN have shown a better performance in the real world and therefore I stopped
using them for the project. (spiega bene)

-> Harder to train the DNN than CNN
-> CNN is less memory constraining and perform better on  loss
