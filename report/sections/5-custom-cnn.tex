\section{Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)}
\label{sec:convolutional-neural-networks-(cnns)}

as already explained before the results on the DNN were convincing but
CNN have shown a better performance in the real world and therefore I stopped
using them for the project. (spiega bene)

-> Harder to train the DNN than CNN
-> CNN is less memory constraining and perform better on  loss


Brief explainantion what a CNN (not state of the art now as Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale exist)
convolutional layers and meaning

\subsection{Model Structure}

\subsubsection{Autotuned CNN}
timey but we ran with kerastuner and show results
also why bayesian tuner

\subsection{Observed Results}
