- First DNN Model generation.
- First CNN Model generation.
  
They should perform in a similar matter but CNN is lighter and, well, state-of-the-art 
approach for image related tasks, so we discard DNN approach.

- Image Augmentation procedure. (From now on always applied)
  - See if it improves the first CNN
- Try to make architecture better -> Add layers to CNN
- Learn best network structure
- Take best network structure and best performing custom CNN
  - Fine tune their learning Hyperparameters
- See case studies
